My post on [Getting started w/ React & Mocha](http://www.bebetterdeveloper.com/coding/getting-started-react-mocha.html) just made it up to the Top 1 of all my blog posts, reaching 1000 uniqueue views, so I decided to continue these series.

## My target

I want to create a simple multilingual website. I need to have:

* source structure and process suitable for mid-sized project
* fast update of UI on language change (desirably without page refresh)
* easy testable solution
* try Redux

I try to use ES6 where it is suitable, I automate dev process using Gulp.

## tl;dr

You can find working code [here](). Just download it and run

~~~
$npm install
~~~

If you are using Visual Studio Code - you can build it using ⇧⌘B (on Mac).

This is how the final result looks like:
